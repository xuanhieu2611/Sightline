## üåü What is Sightline?

Sightline is an AI-powered Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help blind and low-vision individuals understand the world around them through real-time audio descriptions.

Using the phone's camera, Sightline captures what's in front of the user and generates natural, vivid spoken explanations of the scene. The app combines Google's Gemini API for visual understanding and language generation with ElevenLabs for high-quality text-to-speech narration.

The experience is designed to feel like having a personal sighted guide: users simply point their phone toward a scene (like a waterfall, street, or museum exhibit), and Sightline describes what it sees ‚Äî including key objects, spatial context, colors, and atmosphere ‚Äî in a clear and empathetic voice.

### üí° The Problem We're Solving

For millions of people with visual impairments worldwide, everyday tasks like navigating unfamiliar spaces, reading signs and menus, or finding specific objects can be challenging and stressful. Traditional accessibility tools often require expensive specialized hardware or complex setups that aren't practical for daily use.

**Sightline changes that.**

We believe accessibility should be:

- ‚úÖ **Available** - Works on any modern smartphone, no special hardware needed
- ‚úÖ **Instant** - Get immediate audio feedback about your surroundings
- ‚úÖ **Private** - Your data stays secure, nothing is stored without permission
- ‚úÖ **Free** - Accessibility shouldn't come with a price tag

### üéØ How It Works

Sightline combines cutting-edge AI with thoughtful UX design to create three core experiences:

1. **üëÜ Describe** - Point your camera and get instant audio descriptions

   - "Two people ahead. Door slightly right. Clear path left."
   - Perfect for navigating unfamiliar spaces

2. **üìñ Read** (Coming Soon) - OCR functionality for signs and menus

   - Point at text to have it read aloud
   - Works offline with cached models

3. **üîç Live** - Continuous real-time analysis
   - Live scanning with ongoing updates
   - Spatial awareness and object detection
